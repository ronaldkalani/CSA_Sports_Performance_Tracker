# 1. Project Overview

The CSA_Sports_Performance_Tracker project transitions a paper-based model to an interactive platform, focusing on developing positive character traits through workshops, skill reinforcement modules, and performance tracking. The platform provides:
- AI-driven recommendations.
- Gamified progress tracking.
- Tools for coaches to assign modules and monitor athletes.
- Administrative oversight for managing users and content.
  
# 2. Features

1. Athlete Dashboards: Real-time progress tracking with gamification.
2. AI-Driven Insights: Skill recommendations and performance predictions.
3. Workshops and Modules: Focused on leadership, accountability, nutrition, and more.
4. Role-Based Access:
                   - Athletes: Access training modules and track progress.
                   - Coaches: Assign modules and monitor performance.
                   - Admins: Manage users, content, and platform analytics.

# 3. Technology Stack

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Django REST Framework
- Database: PostgreSQL
- AI Models: TensorFlow and PyTorch

# 5. Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Python (v3.9+)
- PostgreSQL (v13+)

# Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/username/LifestyleExcelAthleteGroup.git
cd CSA_Sports_Performance_Tracker

# Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the development server:
npm start

4. Build for production:
npm run build

# Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

2. Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run database migrations:
python manage.py migrate

5. Start the Django server:
python manage.py runserver

# AI Development Setup

1. Navigate to the ai-development directory:
cd ai-development

2. Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Preprocess the data:
python preprocess.py

5. Train the AI models:
python train.py

# 6. How It Works
  # Data Flow
1. Frontend ↔ Backend:
- Athletes interact with the UI, triggering API calls to the backend.
- Example: Fetch training modules or update progress.

2. Backend ↔ Database:
- Backend queries PostgreSQL for user profiles, modules, or progress data.
- Updates user progress and stores analytics.

3. Backend ↔ AI Models:
- Backend sends user data (e.g., training hours) to AI models.
- Models return recommendations or performance predictions.

# 7. Security Features

  # Data Encryption:
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest.
- HTTPS for data in transit.

  # User Authentication:
- Role-based access control for athletes, coaches, and admins.
- Secure password validation and multi-factor authentication.
  
# API Security:
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  
# Database Security:
- Role-based permissions in PostgreSQL.
- Regular automated backups.
  
# Monitoring:
- Logs user actions.
- Intrusion detection with Wazuh.
